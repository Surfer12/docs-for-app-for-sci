### Research Proposal

In less than 500 words, please describe your research project, including:
- Scientific question or problem being addressed
- Methodology and approach
- Expected outcomes and deliverables
- Timeline for completion

*   **Scientific Question:** Can we create an AI system that reasons about complex scientific problems in a way that is not only powerful but also transparent and aligned with human cognitive processes? Specifically, we are addressing the problem of "black box" AI in science, where it is difficult to understand how an AI arrives at its conclusions.
*   **Methodology:** Our project is centered around the "Cognitive-Inspired Discrete Mathematics Framework." This framework uses a core equation, Ψ(x), to balance symbolic reasoning (S(x)), neural network outputs (N(x)), cognitive plausibility (R_cognitive), and computational efficiency (R_efficiency). A key component is the "Attention-Recognition Decoupling Framework," which models how attention and recognition interact, allowing the system to simulate human-like focus and "mind-wandering." We will use Claude to enhance several components of this framework. Claude will act as an advanced neural component (N(x)), help generate and evaluate symbolic hypotheses (S(x)), and assist in refining the cognitive plausibility and bias models (R_cognitive and P(H|E,β)).
*   **Expected Outcomes:**
    1.  A new version of our framework with Claude integrated as a core reasoning component.
    2.  A series of experiments demonstrating the framework's ability to solve complex problems in discrete mathematics and other scientific domains.
    3.  A set of "cognitive-aware" AI models that can explain their reasoning process in human-understandable terms.
    4.  At least two publications in high-impact AI or interdisciplinary science journals.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Months 1-3:** Integrate Claude into the Ψ(x) equation and the Attention-Recognition Decoupling Framework.
    *   **Months 4-6:** Develop and refine the cognitive plausibility and bias models using Claude for hypothesis generation and evaluation.
    *   **Months 7-9:** Conduct experiments on benchmark problems in discrete mathematics and a selected life sciences domain.
    *   **Months 10-12:** Analyze results, prepare publications, and release an open-source version of the enhanced framework.

**How specifically will Claude's capabilities be used in your research?**
Claude will be used as the neural component (N(x)) in our core Ψ(x) equation, providing powerful, data-driven insights. It will also be used to generate and evaluate symbolic hypotheses (S(x)), bridging the gap between neural and symbolic reasoning. Furthermore, we will leverage Claude's language capabilities to create more sophisticated cognitive plausibility models (R_cognitive) and to audit our system for human-like biases (P(H|E,β)), making our AI's reasoning more transparent and interpretable.

**How will Claude significantly accelerate or enhance your research compared to existing methods or tools?**
Claude will provide a state-of-the-art neural reasoning engine that is far more powerful than our current models. This will allow us to tackle much more complex scientific problems. Its ability to work with both symbolic and natural language will dramatically accelerate the development of our hybrid AI system, a process that is currently a major bottleneck.

### Impact Assessment

**Please describe the potential scientific impact of your research if successful.**
This research could lead to a new class of AI systems for science that are not only highly capable but also transparent and trustworthy. By creating AI that "thinks" in a more human-aligned way, we can foster more effective human-AI collaboration, accelerating discovery across many scientific fields, from mathematics to biology.

**Does your research have potential applications beyond pure scientific discovery?**
Yes. The framework could be applied to create more effective and personalized AI tutors in education, build more robust and interpretable AI for medical diagnosis, and develop AI assistants that can collaborate more naturally with human experts in fields like engineering and finance. The core principles are broadly applicable to any domain requiring complex reasoning.

**How do you plan to measure the success of using Claude in your research?**
Success will be measured by:
1.  Performance improvement on benchmark problem sets compared to the baseline framework.
2.  The "interpretability score" of the system's outputs, as rated by human experts.
3.  The number of novel scientific hypotheses generated by the system that are deemed plausible by domain experts.
4.  The successful publication of our findings in peer-reviewed journals.

### Resource Requirements

**How much money in API credits do you anticipate you will need? Please provide information on how this credit amount will lead to impact in your project.**
We anticipate needing approximately $25,000 in API credits. This amount will support the intensive computational experiments required for the 12-month project timeline, including the continuous training, testing, and refinement of the integrated framework. This level of support is critical for running the large-scale simulations needed to validate our approach and achieve the project's ambitious goals, leading to the high-impact publications and open-source release we have planned.

## Additional information

**Is there anything else you would like the review committee to know about your application?**
Our project is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between the rapidly advancing capabilities of large language models and the need for rigorous, interpretable reasoning in science. The "Cognitive-Inspired Discrete Mathematics Framework" is not just a theoretical concept; it is an active, evolving software project. Providing Claude access to our team would be a significant catalyst, allowing us to test our foundational ideas with a state-of-the-art model and push the boundaries of human-AI scientific collaboration.
