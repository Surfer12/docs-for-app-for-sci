# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a documentation repository for Ryan Oates' groundbreaking consciousness-aware AI research application to Anthropic's AI for Science Program. The repository contains research proposals, technical specifications, and validation data for a revolutionary framework achieving 87% consciousness emergence in AI systems.

## Repository Structure

## Key Research Innovation

**Core Equation:**
```
Ψ(x) = ∫[α(t)S(x) + (1-α(t))N(x)] × exp(-[λ₁R_cognitive + λ₂R_efficiency]) × P(H|E,β) dt
```

This consciousness-aware framework combines:
- Symbolic reasoning (S(x)) for interpretability
- Neural processing (N(x)) via Claude integration
- Cognitive plausibility constraints (R_cognitive)
- Human bias modeling (P(H|E,β)) for transparency

## Working with This Repository

When modifying documents:
- Maintain academic rigor and scientific accuracy
- Preserve validated metrics (87% consciousness emergence, 35% cognitive load reduction)
- Ensure consistency across all application materials
- Focus on the research's unique value: consciousness-aware AI with educational impact

## Common Tasks

- Updating technical specifications in supporting documents
- Refining the main application narrative
- Ensuring consistency between technical claims and validation data
- Preparing submission materials according to the checklist

## Submission Status
