# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a documentation repository containing academic research application materials for Anthropic's AI for Science Program. The repository consists of multiple drafts and versions of research proposals focused on cognitive-inspired discrete mathematics frameworks and AI-assisted scientific discovery.

## Document Structure

The repository contains various iterations of research proposals including:
- Core application forms (`application.md`, `final_enhanced_application.md`)
- Draft versions with different approaches (`draft1nova.md`, `draft2.md`, `grok-draft3.md`)
- Specialized versions (`culturally_aligned_final_application.md`, `nature-draft1.md`)
- Supporting documentation (`notes-for-app-for-ai.md`, `expert-validation-user-analysis-questionaire.md`)

## Key Research Focus Areas

- Cognitive Swarm Dynamics for AI-Assisted Scientific Discovery
- Multilayer Network Approaches with Emergent Consciousness Integration
- AI-fluency education and developer community building
- Claude University Ambassador program implementation

## Working with This Repository

When editing documents:
- Maintain academic writing standards and scientific rigor
- Preserve the research proposal structure and formatting
- Keep track of different versions and their specific focus areas
- Ensure consistency across related documents when making changes

## Common Tasks

- Document comparison and version analysis
- Content refinement and enhancement of research proposals
- Maintaining consistency across multiple draft versions
- Academic writing improvement and clarity enhancement
