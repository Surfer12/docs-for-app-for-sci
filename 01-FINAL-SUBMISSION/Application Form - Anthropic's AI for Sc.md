# Application Form - Anthropic's AI for Science Program

This program provides API credits to researchers working on high-impact scientific projects, with a particular focus on biology and life sciences applications. 

The AI for Science program offers API credits to qualified nonprofit and academic researchers who will be selected based on their scientific credentials, the potential impact of their proposed research, and AI's ability to meaningfully accelerate their work. We are particularly interested in supporting applications in biology and life sciences where AI can assist in accelerating processes related to understanding complex biological systems, analyzing genetic data, accelerating drug discovery especially for some of the largest global disease burdens, increasing agricultural productivity, and more. 

This program provides free API credits for our standard model suite. Applicants through this program do not receive exemption from our Usage Policy, our Trust & Safety team will follow our standard enforcement procedures and take action whenever an organization’s prompt activity hits our violation rate thresholds. 

We evaluate submissions on the first Monday of each month. This schedule helps us manage the program sustainably. Please note that if this timeline poses a significant obstacle for the applicant, it does not block them from simply purchasing API credits in the interim. 

If successful, we will apply up to $50,000 API credits to your account. The specific amount will be communicated as part of the evaluation process.

Given the substantial number of applications we receive, we regret that we cannot provide individual responses to unapproved submissions. However, we appreciate the time and effort put into each submission and will carefully review all entries.
